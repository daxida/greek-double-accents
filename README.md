WIP.

Analyze Greek sentences for missing double accents.

## How to install

```
pip install git+https://github.com/daxida/greek-double-accents
```

## How to run

Simply run the command: `gda`. At the moment this defaults to point at `book.txt` for testing but you can run:
```
gda -i "path/to/file.txt" -s PICA -m "1VERBP"
```
